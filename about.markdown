## My Story

Originally from the rural Appalachian Mountain region of New Jersey, I loved tinkering with electronics
and computers. Playing guitar got me more interested in electronics, and so I decided to go to school
for electrical engineering at The College of New Jersey. After finishing my degree, I went to work
for an Army R&D facility doing embedded hardware and software engineering. I found that even though
I enjoyed the hardware portion, I found the creative aspects of coding far more enticing, so I started
to focus more on that. After a few years, my wife and I made our way down to North Carolina, where I
solidified my C coding and started to branch out into other languages. I learned web development while
working on [a real estate website](http://dropbuylabs.com/) with some friends, and decided to learn
more about that part of the stack. I now do a mixture of web development, embedded engineering, and
digital art out of Durham, NC on a freelance basis.

When I'm not in front of a text editor, I love spending time with my wife and our cats, Pancake and
Flapjack. I also enjoy playing guitar and bass, traveling, and playing tabletop and video games. When
the weather is nice out (and sometimes when it isn't) you can usually find me running, hiking, or rock
climbing. I also enjoy photography - all of the images on this site are my own.

## Other Writings

This site is meant to supersede my old site, [graphsandwords.com](http://www.graphsandwords.com), which
will remain up until I can move the content to this site (and perhaps after). There you can find links
to my work from all over the web.

I also have works on the [EETimes](http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1324303) site
and on the [SmashingBoxes](http://smashingboxes.com/bio/brian-carrigan) blog.
