My goal as a technologist is to satisfy human needs and generate business value through the use of technology. If you are an organization looking to expand your digital capabilities, I would love to work with you.

My model as an independent consultant is to provide high-quality services with no overhead. I work with a network of other freelancers to make sure that the right skills are available to meet your needs. In specific, my core competencies are:

- Connected devices and IoT system integration.
- Backend and systems development in several languages.
- Electronics design, PCB layout, firmware, and production assistance.
- Production grade devops and test frameworks.

Please look through my projects and blog posts, and if you're interested in talking about how innovative technology can help you and your company, lets get in touch!
