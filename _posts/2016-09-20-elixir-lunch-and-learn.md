I have recently been working on Smashing Boxes' first Elixir project, and it has been fantastic. As
a primarily Ruby shop, I wanted to create a presentation about what the experience has been like so
far. Just like my blog, I've wanted my presentations to be focused on content over style and tedium,
so I've switched over to [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) for my slide decks. A nice side
effect of this is that I can share them to a larger audience.

If you use Ruby for web development and are interested in the tradeoffs that Elixir and Phoenix
bring, check out the full presentation [here](/elixir-ruby-experience) and let me know what you think.
