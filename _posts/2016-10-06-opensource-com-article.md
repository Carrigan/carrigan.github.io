With my talk coming up at
[All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/talk/creating-interactive-art-with-open-source/), I
recently wrote an article about why and how I got started in doing digital art. In retrospect, it
is amazing how learning the tools discussed in this article changed the way that I approach
software. Huge thanks to Processing, Arduino, and the entire open source community for what they do;
I am honored to be a small part of such a wonderful community.
