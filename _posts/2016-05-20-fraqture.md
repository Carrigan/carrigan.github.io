At SB, we've been working hard on shipping Fraqture, our open source art platform. We are happy to
announce that it will be on display in the 21C storefront window on Main St. in downtown Durham for
the next few months.

Check out my
[recent post](http://smashingboxes.com/blog/introducing-fraqture-a-platform-for-uniting-tech-and-art)
about why and how we built Fraqture, and see our [splash page](http://www.fraqture.com) for more info
on what will be on display and how you can get involved.
